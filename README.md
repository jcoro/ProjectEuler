# Project Euler in Java
This repository contains some Java implementations of problems on [projectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).

This repo is just some personal coding practice performed in my spare time. No problem is claimed to be solved optimally, although the siteâ€™s overview PDFs are included for completed problems. 

If you have any questions I'd be happy to try and help. Please contact me at: john@coronite.net.
